#' A lightweight R wrapper to access Spotify API
#' @description This package allows you to make requests to Spotify Web API to
#'   retrieve information such as audio features, audio analysis for a track,
#'   artist's top tracks, similar artists given a artist, etc.
#'   Although the package does not included all the available requests to
#'   Spotify's API, important requests such as search for an item in Spotify are
#'   included to allow you to retrieve playlists, albums, artists or tracks of
#'   interest. This subsequently allows you to collect audio features or audio
#'   analysis of the respective tracks within the playlists or albums retrieved
#'   from the previous search.
